A simple reading list helps me actually finish books and articles instead of losing them in tabs.

I keep a single markdown file: title, author, status (reading / done), and a line or two of notes when I’m done. No fancy tool, just something I can grep and edit anywhere.

For papers and long articles I do the same: title, link or path, and a short summary. Over time it becomes a searchable log of what I’ve read and what I thought. I sometimes cross-link from blog posts or project notes to this list.

The format doesn’t matter as much as doing it consistently. Plain text and version control are enough.
