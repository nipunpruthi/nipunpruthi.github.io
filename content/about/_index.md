I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at [ixigo](https://www.ixigo.com), and I love building backend systems that scale and stay reliable.

I did my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in). Since then I've worked on high-throughput services, APIs, and event-driven systems—system design, relational and NoSQL databases, message queues, caching, and cloud infrastructure. I like to keep the big picture clear: good design, observability, and shipping things that actually work.

I'm also curious about **AI and how it's changing the way we build and use software**—everything from tooling to product. When I'm not coding, I like to read and explore.

I'm always up for a **discussion or a casual chat**, whether it's backend, distributed systems, or something new. If you'd like to meet and talk over a cup of green tea (or coffee!), feel free to reach out. Happy to connect.
