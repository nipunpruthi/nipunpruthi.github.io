I'm a backend engineer. I completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in).

I've built and owned high-throughput systems at scale. I work with Java, Spring, SQL/NoSQL, Kafka, and cloud infra, and care about clear design and shipping things that work. When I'm not coding, I like to read and explore.
