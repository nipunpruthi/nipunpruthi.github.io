## Hire a Senior Software Engineer / Backend Engineer

I'm **Nipun Pruthi**, a **Senior Software Engineer** and **backend engineer** who likes owning problems and building systems from **0 to 1** at scale. I'm **actively looking for new opportunities** and **open to relocation**.

**Open to:** Full-time roles, contract positions, and contract-to-hire.

---

### What I do

- **Backend & microservices** — APIs, distributed systems, system design. Relational and NoSQL databases, message queues, caching, and cloud (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker). I care about clear design, observability, and reliability.
- **Ownership** — I take end-to-end ownership: from design and implementation to production. I've shipped and run coupon platforms, payment integrations, reconciliation services, and catalog systems.
- **Tech stack** — Backend services, microservices, SQL & NoSQL DBs, event-driven systems, caching, cloud infra. I'm language-agnostic when it comes to solving problems and **always up to discuss any tech**—whether it's something I've used before or something new.
- **AI** — I'm curious about **AI and how it's changing how we build and ship software**—from tooling and productivity to product. Happy to work in or around AI-enabled products and platforms.

### Impact

- **0→1 and scale** — Built and scaled systems from scratch (e.g. 20M+ daily requests); improved conversion and time-to-market; reduced manual ops and prevented production downtime.
- **Ownership** — Led design, delivery, and cross-functional pods; zero-downtime releases and full lineage for critical flows.
- **Background** — IIT Roorkee (B.Tech). Experience at ixigo (Senior Software Engineer), Tide, Flipkart, Texas Instruments.
