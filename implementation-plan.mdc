# Implementation Plan – Hugo Personal Site (GitHub Pages)

Track progress: one feature at a time, test, then next. Mark steps with [Done] and a short summary.

---

## 1. Scaffold Hugo site + GitHub Pages config
- [Done] Site structure created manually (no `hugo new site` required): hugo.toml, archetypes, content sections, layouts (baseof, partials head/nav/footer), default list/single, static/css, .gitignore.
- [Done] GitHub Pages: baseURL set to https://nipunpruthi.github.io/, publishDir = public; .github/workflows/hugo.yml added to build and deploy on push to main.

---

## 2. Landing page
- [Done] Hero with greeting and tagline; greeting/tagline from site params (hugo.toml) with optional page override in content/_index.md. CSS: hero-greeting (large, bold), hero-tagline (accent color, italic).

## 3. About me page
- [Done] layouts/section/about.html: title + body content; optional front matter `image` for profile photo (two-column on larger screens). content/about/_index.md has placeholder bio.

## 4. Experience page
- [Done] Timeline: data/experience.yaml (entries: role, company, start, end, description). layouts/section/experience.html renders timeline; CSS vertical line + markers + period/role/description.

## 5. Blogs section
- [Done] layouts/section/blog.html (list with date, tags, summary); layouts/blog/single.html (date, tags, content). Sample posts in content/blog/ with tags. README.md added with commands, structure, profile image, experience, blog, deploy.

## 6. Blogs: tags + filter by tags
- [Done] layouts/taxonomy/terms.html (all tags at /tags/); layouts/taxonomy/term.html (posts per tag at /tags/name/); partial blog-tag-filter.html on blog list. Tag links on posts point to tag pages.

## 7. Blogs: search
- [Done] Client-side search: partial blog-search.html (label + input + no-results message), data-search on each .post-item (title + plainify summary + tags), blog-search-script.html filters list by query words; used on blog list and tag term pages.

## 8. Papershelf page
- [Done] data/papershelf.yaml (title, authors, source, year, url, comment); layouts/section/papershelf.html; intro in content/papershelf/_index.md. Nav: show_papershelf = false in hugo.toml hides Papershelf link (page still at /papershelf/).

## 9. Photos page
- [ ] Gallery section and layout

## 10. Polish & deploy
- [ ] Nav links, RSS, GitHub Actions
